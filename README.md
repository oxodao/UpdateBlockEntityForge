All credits goes to [apple502j](https://github.com/apple502j/UpdateBlockEntity)'s for making this mod

Huge thanks to [LlamaLad7](https://github.com/llamalad7) from the Forge discord community to help me troubleshoot some issue

- DO NOT USE IT WITHOUT BACKUPS
- REMOVE ONCE THE WORLD IS CONVERTED

No support will be given, I've made this just to port my server's world, if it can help you that's cool, if it can't thats unfortunate but feel free to modify it to make it suit your need

Also, PLEASE do not go ask support to apple502j either since they has nothing to do with this port and won't be able to help you (or maybe they could but there probably is a reason if they did not port it to forge by himself, that probably means they don't want to deal with any of this)

PR / issue won't even be read


tldr: Do not ask support for anyone, if it works thats good, if it don't thats a bummer.
